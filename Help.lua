        "Plexus uses a priority system to let you show more information in less space. You can assign two statuses to the same indicator, and then when they're both active, only the one with the higher priority will be shown.",
        "For example, if you're a priest, you might assign Power Word: Shield (yellow, high priority) and Weakened Soul (red, low priority) to the Top Left Corner indicator. When you cast Power Word: Shield on a unit, you'll see a yellow square representing the shield buff. If the shield is consumed before the Weakened Soul effect ends, then you'll see a red square in the same place representing the Weakened Soul debuff.",
        "If your class can dispel both Magic and Poison debuffs, you might assign both Debuff Type: Magic (blue, high priority) and Debuff Type: Poison (green, low priority) to the Frame border indicator. When a unit has only one type of debuff, the frame border will be highlighted with the color for that debuff. If a unit has both types of debuffs, the frame border would be blue, showing the higher priority Magic debuff.",

Instead, the core addon tries to include the basic features everyone needs, and offer a simple plugin system so developers can easily add more features. Here is a short list of some popular plugins and companion addons you can find on Curse.com . Note: Compatible with Grid plugins NOT Grid2",
        "{Click casting} allows you to bind clicks to spells. For example, you could bind Shift-Click to cast Flash Heal. If you're interested in this functionality, we suggest {Clique} by Cladhaire as a great standalone addon that adds click-casting to all unit frames, including Plexus.",
        "{Debuffs} allows you to see important debuffs I recommend also checking out the expantion debbuff lists that go with it. If you're interested in this functionality, we suggest {GridStatusDungeonDebuff} by Me(Doadin) and bstassart as a great plugin.",
